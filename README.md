## What is Maxun?

Maxun helps you transform websites into structured APIs, clean markdown for AI workflows, and production-ready data pipelines — all in minutes.

### Ecosystem

1. **[Extract](https://docs.maxun.dev/category/extract)** – Emulate real user behavior and collect structured data from any website. No code required.
   * **[Recorder Mode](https://docs.maxun.dev/robot/extract/robot-actions)** - Record your actions as you browse; Maxun turns them into a reusable extraction robot.
   * **[AI Mode](https://docs.maxun.dev/robot/extract/llm-extraction)** - Describe what you want in natural language and let LLM-powered extraction do the rest.

2. **[Scrape](https://docs.maxun.dev/robot/scrape/scrape-robots)** – Convert full webpages into clean Markdown or HTML and capture screenshots. Ideal for AI workflows, agents, and document processing. No code required.
3. **[Crawl](https://docs.maxun.dev/robot/crawl/crawl-introduction)** - Crawl entire websites and extract content from every relevant page, with full control over scope and discovery.
4. **[Search](https://docs.maxun.dev/robot/search/search-introduction)** - Run automated web searches to discover or scrape results, with support for time-based filters.
5. **[SDK](https://docs.maxun.dev/sdk/sdk-overview)** – A complete developer toolkit for scraping, extraction, scheduling, and end-to-end data automation.

## How Does It Work?

Maxun robots are automated tools that help you collect data from websites without writing any code. Think of them as your personal web assistants that can navigate websites, extract information, and organize data just like you would manually - but faster and more efficiently.

There are four types of robots, each designed for a different job.

### 1. Extract
Extract emulates real user behavior and captures structured data.
- <a href="/robot/extract/robot-actions">Recorder Mode</a> - Record your actions as you browse; Maxun turns them into a reusable extraction robot.
### Example: Extract 10 Property Listings from Airbnb

- <a href="/robot/extract/llm-extraction">AI Mode</a> - Describe what you want in natural language and let LLM-powered extraction do the rest.
### Example: Extract Names, Rating & Duration of Top 50 Movies from IMDb
